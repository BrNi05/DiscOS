# Privacy Policy

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy is an extension of the [DiscOS Terms of Service](https://github.com/BrNi05/DiscOS/blob/main/.github/TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md). By using DiscOS clones, you agree to comply with both the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy.

## 2. Discord's terms

By using DiscOS clones, you agree to [Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).

## 3. Data collection

By default, DiscOS clones do not collect or store any user data, nor do they log user activity.
An exception is logging related to security and stability: admin commands, crashes, and critical configuration changes are logged.

## 4. Instance specific policy

DiscOS clone admins are solely responsible for informing their users and complying with relevant data protection laws (such as GDPR).

Admins can reference this Privacy Policy, but should always clearly state custom policies for users (before any data collection occurs).

## 5. Admin-configurable logging

By using an external backend, admins have means to enable logging or analytics (without modifying the source code, thus ToS continues to apply).

Admins are encouraged to follow the principle of minimal logging as well as security and data protection best practices.

## 6. Version history

- 2025.08.30: first edition
- 2025.12.22: second edition (update logging related terms)
